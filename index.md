# Welcome to TheFreePenguin's official site!

Who am I?
I'm just a hobbyist coder who writes bash scripts!

I like to install Linux+ distros, and make it easier to install the hard ones. (Linux+ meaning Linux, BSD, Haiku, and ReactOS)

My Projects:
[Gentoo Installer with More Customization](thefreepenguin.github.io/gentoo-quick-installer)
